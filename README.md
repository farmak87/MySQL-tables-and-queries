# MySQL scripts

This repository contains SQL scirpts that I used during the project. 
  1. create_table.sql - creates all necessary tables
  2. update_cumulative30d_procedure.sql and update_cumulative90d_procedure.sql - those are procedures that update recharge history of pseudo-customers for last 30 and 90 days.
  3. distribution_and_collection.sql - the scritp shows how many pseudo-money was distributed and collected every day. (used in Tableau)
  4. collection_trend.sql - the script shows pseudo-money collection trend.(used in Tableau)
